# -Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media-Project

Project Overview
The Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media project is a machine learning application designed to automatically classify and tag images of landmarks. The project addresses the challenge of inferring the location of photos that lack metadata, a common issue when images are uploaded to social media platforms without embedded GPS data. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system can accurately identify and classify landmarks depicted in photos, enabling features like automatic tagging and photo organization based on location.

Key Components
Data Preprocessing: The project involves extensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning and augmentation, to prepare the dataset for training. This ensures that the model is robust and can handle various image conditions.

Model Training: Using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, the project trains multiple models to classify landmarks. The models are optimized for accuracy and performance, capable of distinguishing between numerous landmarks worldwide.

Web Application: A user-friendly web application is developed to allow users to upload photos and receive predictions about the landmarks in the images. This application serves as a practical demonstration of the model's capabilities, providing immediate feedback and tags for uploaded images.

Deployment: The trained model is deployed as a web service, making it accessible for real-world applications. The deployment ensures that the model can be easily integrated into photo-sharing services or other platforms requiring image location tagging.

Problem Solved
The project solves the problem of missing location metadata in photos by providing an automated solution to identify landmarks. This feature is crucial for enhancing user experience in photo-sharing platforms, as it facilitates automatic tagging and organization of images based on recognized landmarks.

Achievements
The project showcases the application of advanced machine learning techniques in the field of computer vision, particularly in image classification and tagging. It also highlights the importance of deep learning in solving practical problems related to digital media and social platforms.
